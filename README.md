This project implements a basic chess game. It defines the piece types, piece colors, and intializes the chess board with pieces in their correct positions. The program includes functions to display the board, convert algebraic notation to the board coordinates, checks the validity of the moves for each piece, and handles special moves such as pawn promotion, en passant, and castling. This game also simulates turns for both players (human and AI). The main function orcheestrates the game by initliazing the board, alternating turns for both players, and checking coniditions for checkmate or stalemate conditions that will end the game.
